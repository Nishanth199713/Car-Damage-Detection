# Car-Damage-Detection
Development of a system of recognition of scratches in cars and preparing a detailed report about the scratches and other car details like make, model and license plate using Conventional Neural Networks. This Process is done by recording a video that splits the video into several data frames. Starting from the license plate at the rear end of the car and is recorded in a clockwise direction. The data frame consisting of the license plate is kept separately while the other data frames are used for identifying scratches .This Project implements Deep Learning Techniques. Pandas were used to split the recorded video into separate data frames.
